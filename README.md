  * Support zip-file endpoints, unzips documents transparently
  * [Examples](/examples) written to support both Node and Deno
  * Supports Deno *and* Node
  * Fully Typed, written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  * ESM (Deno, Node) and CommonJS (Node) support
  * Adds description to codes while parsing the documents


## Installation

Make sure to use a recent version of your runtime, Node.js `>=18` and Deno `>=1.26` is supported.

**Deno**
```javascript
import { QueryConfiguration } from "https://deno.land/x/entsoe_api_client/mod.ts";
```

**Node**
```
npm install entsoe-api-client --save
```


## Documentation

Library and method documentation can be found at [deno.land/x/entsoe_api_client](https://deno.land/x/entsoe_api_client@0.9.4/mod.ts).

Documents structure and parameters returned by this library closely resemble what you find in [ENTSO-e REST API documentation](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/content/static_content/Static%20content/web%20api/Guide.html), so have a look there too.

If you want a `Publication_MarketDocument`, the corresponding function in this library is `QueryPublication`. In the resulting document (object), the key `receiver_MarketParticipant.mRID` will become `receiverMarketParticipantId`. The same goes for parameters. We recommend have auto-completion enabled in your editor, the types will give great help in navigating the parameters and document objects.

Another difference compared to source documents is that most ids automatically get a complementary description, where applicable. 
As an example `businessType`=`B33` in the raw xml will result in keys `businessType: "B33"` and `businessTypeDescription: "Area Control Error"` in the output.


## Examples

Examples can be found in the [/examples](/examples) directory.

To run the examples, pass your ENTSO-e API key by environment variable `API_TOKEN`.

**Deno**

Powershell
```
$env:API_TOKEN="your-api-token"; deno run -A .\spot-prices-today.ts
```
Bash
```
API_TOKEN="your-api-token" deno run -A .\spot-prices-today.ts
```

**Node**

Powershell
```
$env:API_TOKEN="your-api-token"; node .\spot-prices-today.ts
```
Bash
```
API_TOKEN="your-api-token" node .\spot-prices-today.ts
```
