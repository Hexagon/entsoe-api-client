Make sure to use a recent version of your runtime. Node.js `>=18` and Deno `>=1.26` are supported.

**Deno**
```javascript
import { QueryConfiguration } from "https://deno.land/x/entsoe_api_client/mod.ts";
```

**Node**
```
npm install entsoe-api-client --save
```

> **Note**
> Using an older version of Node.js? Use 0.x versions of this library for fetch compatibility.
